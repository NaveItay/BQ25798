/**
 * @file
 *    I2C_HPP
 *
 * @brief
 *    This header file is part of a library that facilitates I2C communication for Arduino-based systems, specifically tailored for the ESP32.
 *    It provides functions for initializing the I2C bus, reading and writing bytes and byte arrays to and from I2C devices.
 *
 *    Key Features:
 *    - Support for Standard Mode (100 kHz) and Fast Mode (400 kHz) I2C communication.
 *    - Functions for reading and writing single bytes and arrays of bytes over I2C.
 *    - Customizable SDA and SCL pins and clock frequency.
 *
 *    This library abstracts the complexities of I2C communication, making it simpler to interface with I2C devices.
 *    It is ideal for projects requiring communication with sensors, displays, and other peripherals using the I2C protocol.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *    i2cBegin(ESP32_I2C_SDA, ESP32_I2C_SCL, SCL_CLOCK_FREQUENCY);  // Initialize I2C
 *    uint8_t data = i2cReadByte(DEVICE_ADDRESS, REGISTER_ADDRESS); // Read a byte from a device
 *    i2cWriteByte(DEVICE_ADDRESS, REGISTER_ADDRESS, data);         // Write a byte to a device
